CODE:

1. CREATE TABLE Gym ( 2.  gym_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 3.  gym_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 4.  location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL 5. );

Each gym has a unique ID, name and location.

6. CREATE TABLE Member ( 7.  member_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 8.  member_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 9.  member_phone VARCHAR(15), 10.  member_email VARCHAR(100), 11.  join_date DATE, 12.  gym_id INT, 13.  FOREIGN KEY (gym_id) REFERENCES Gym(gym_id) 14. );

member_id = unique member.

gym_id connects member to their gym.

15. CREATE TABLE Trainer ( 16.  trainer_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 17.  trainer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 18.  specialization VARCHAR(100), 19.  gym_id INT, 20.  FOREIGN KEY (gym_id) REFERENCES Gym(gym_id) 21. );

trainer_id = unique trainer.

specialization = e.g., yoga, cardio.

Linked to gym.

22. CREATE TABLE MembershipPlan ( 23.  plan_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 24.  plan_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 25.  duration_months INT, 26.  fees DECIMAL(10,2) 27. );

Stores gym plan: name, duration in months, and fee.

28. CREATE TABLE Enrollment ( 29.  enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 30.  member_id INT, 31.  plan_id INT, 32.  enrollment_date DATE, 33.  FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES Member(member_id), 34.  FOREIGN KEY (plan_id) REFERENCES MembershipPlan(plan_id) 35. );

This links members to their plans. Each row = one enrollment.
