ðŸ§ª PRACTICAL 8 â€“ Views and DML Using Views

1. Create View:

```sql
CREATE VIEW Employee_View AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary FROM Employee;
```
ðŸ”¸ Creates a virtual table (View) showing a subset of Employee data.

2. Select from View:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee_View;
```
ðŸ”¸ Retrieves all rows from the view.

3. Update data using View:

```sql
UPDATE Employee_View
SET salary = salary + 2000
WHERE emp_id = 102;
```
ðŸ”¸ Increases salary for emp_id 102 by 2000.

4. Insert data (if view is updatable):

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee_View VALUES (105, 'Neha', 47000);
```
ðŸ”¸ Inserts new record through the view.

5. Delete data using View:

```sql
DELETE FROM Employee_View WHERE emp_id = 101;
```
ðŸ”¸ Deletes a record using the view (works only if view is simple, not based on joins).
