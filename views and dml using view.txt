CREATE VIEW Employee_View AS
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, salary
FROM Employee;
Step 2: Select data from the View

sql

SELECT * FROM Employee_View;
Step 3: Insert using View (works only on simple views):

If allowed by DBMS, do:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO Employee_View VALUES (105, 'Neha', 47000);
If not allowed, insert into base table instead.

Step 4: Update using View:

sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE Employee_View
SET salary = salary + 2000
WHERE emp_id = 102;
Step 5: Delete using View:

sql
Copy

DELETE FROM Employee_View
WHERE emp_id = 103;
üìù Notes:

Views let you control access to sensitive columns.

You can query or modify data using views if they are ‚Äúsimple views‚Äù (no joins or aggregations).
